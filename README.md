# 📚 **Access Control Attendance System**

## 📝 **Project Overview**
The **Access Control Attendance System** is a robust, Python-based application designed to manage and monitor access control and attendance records efficiently. This project leverages face recognition technology for authentication and attendance tracking, providing a seamless and secure solution for organizations.

## 🌟 **Features**

1. **🔐 Face Recognition-Based Access Control**:
   - 🎥 Real-time detection and recognition of faces using a camera feed.
   - ✅ Grant or deny access based on pre-registered user data.

2. **📂 Dataset Management**:
   - 🛠️ Easily create and manage datasets for user registration.
   - 🧠 Train models to encode facial features for efficient recognition.

3. **📋 Attendance Tracking**:
   - 🕒 Automatic attendance marking upon successful authentication.
   - 📊 Attendance records stored in CSV files for easy access and analysis.

4. **🛡️ Access Logs**:
   - 📜 Maintain detailed logs of access events for enhanced security.

5. **💻 Intuitive GUI**:
   - 🤖 User-friendly graphical interface for controlling and monitoring the system.

- 🛠️ Libraries and dependencies (see below)

### 🔽 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yPrari2725/ACCESS-CONTROL-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM.git
cd ACCESS-CONTROL-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 **Usage**

### ▶️ Running the Application
1. Launch the main application:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```
2. Use the GUI to:
   - 📸 Create datasets
   - 🔧 Train the dataset
   - ✅ Recognize faces for access control
   - 📂 View attendance records

### 📸 Dataset Creation
- Add new users by running the "Create Dataset" feature, which captures multiple images of a user and stores them for training.

### 🧠 Training the Model
- Train the face recognition model using the "Train Dataset" feature to encode facial features.

### 🎥 Real-Time Recognition
- Start the "Recognize + Access Control" feature to authenticate users and log attendance in real-time.

### 📂 Access Attendance Records
- View attendance sheets directly through the GUI or access the CSV files stored in the `CSV_sheet` folder.
